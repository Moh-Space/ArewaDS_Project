# ArewaDS_Project
My project is about using APIs in Python 
i was able to use the api link: https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars 
i was use python libraries such as pygal, pandas, seaborn, requests to make API call, summarise them and tehn visualise them into an svg file
the idea is use the power of python to have access data and visual it.
